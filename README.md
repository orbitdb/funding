# OrbitDB Funding

[OrbitDB](https://www.github.com/orbitdb/orbitdb) is a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. OrbitDB uses IPFS as its data storage and Libp2p Pubsub to automatically sync databases with peers. It's an eventually consistent database that uses Merkle-CRDTs for conflict-free database writes and merges making OrbitDB an excellent choice for p2p and decentralized apps, blockchain applications and local-first web applications.

OrbitDB is built by a group of volunteers who are passionate about decentralization, privacy, censorship-resistance and open source. OrbitDB also thrives because of our strong community who provide support through funding, code and other contributions.
